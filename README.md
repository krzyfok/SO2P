Chat Server and Dining Philosophers 

This repository contains two separate projects:

1.  Chat Server  – a multithreaded TCP client-server chat application.
    
2.  Dining Philosophers  – a simulation of the classical Dining Philosophers problem using threads.

Chat Server 

How to Run :  
g++ Server.cpp -o Server -lws2\_32  
g++ Client.cpp -o Client -lws2\_32  
./Server  
./Client

Problem Description :  
A simple Client-Server chat using TCP sockets. It allows multiple clients to communicate simultaneously using multithreading and synchronization of shared resources.

Threads :

-   Server main thread : listens for incoming connections and creates new threads for clients.
    
-   Client thread (per connection) : handles communication with a single client.
    
-   Client listening thread : receives data from the server.
    
-   Client main thread : sends data to the server.
    

Critical Sections :

-   Reading chat history 
    
-   Adding messages to chat history 

-   Sending messages to clients 
    
-   Adding clients 
    
-   Removing clients 
    

Deadlock Avoidance :  
Each critical section uses only a single mutex; no waiting for multiple resources occurs.

Dining Philosophers Problem 🍴

How to Run :  
g++ main.cpp -o projekt  
./projekt (number\_of\_philosophers)

Problem Description :  
Simulation of the classical Dining Philosophers problem, where philosophers need access to shared resources (forks) to eat while avoiding deadlocks.

Threads :

-   Each philosopher is a separate thread that cycles through:
    
      Thinking 
        
      Becoming hungry 
        
      Trying to eat 
        

Critical Sections :

-   Accessing forks : synchronized using mutex and condition\_variable to ensure neighbors do not eat simultaneously.
    
-   condition\_variable prevents philosophers from busy-waiting; they are notified when forks become available .
    

Deadlock Avoidance :  
A philosopher waits until both forks are available before picking them up. After eating, the philosopher notifies neighbors that the forks have been released 📢.
